I'm a guy that just want create something interesting!
Here you can see what I'm mainly working on:
- Physics is cool! Destruction is cool! Destruction physics is OMEGA LUL!
- Sandbox elements are never too many.
- If you can create a interactive visualization of process - do it!
- Ramakes of old ideas are not bad, if they good.

And... I don't mind about the collab )
